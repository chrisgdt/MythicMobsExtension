/**
 * The function of this class is a bit shaky. It is mostly to avoid use of NMS
 * code to create a proper EID. This class creates Entity IDs that are used by
 * minecraft to identify entities in the protocol. There are two ways to break
 * the function of this class and risk server errors or client crashing: - A
 * world with 2 billion entites at once might cause client crashes. - A user of
 * this library creating 147,483,647 entities with this class would beak
 * something. I think the server would crash, but I'm not 100% sure. Java would
 * wrap the entity ids back to negative max value, which is likely to cause
 * trouble.
